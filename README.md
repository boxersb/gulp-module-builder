# gulp-module-builder

You can write module list file as modules `manifesto` and build by gulp.

## Install

```bash
npm install gulp-module-builder --save-dev
```

## Usage

### Manifesto

[gulp-module-builder] requires specific `manifesto`.
The manifesto follows `json` format and composit by `key-value(array)` pair.
`key` means name of module and `value` means file list as array for member of module.
You can write globbing pattern such as `*` or `**/*` in module list. So, plugin ignores no exist file in manifesto. By default, plugin not allows duplicate in file list.

***Manifesto example (`modules.json`)***:
```js
{
    "simple-module": [
        "./src/foo.js",
        "./src/bar.js",
        "./src/common/namespace.js",
        "./src/common/*.js",
        "./src/service/**/*.js"
    ]
}
```

### Write task

```js
var builder = require('gulp-module-builder');

gulp.task('build', function() {
    gulp.src('./modules.json')
        .pipe(builder())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/')); // ./dist/simple-module.js file created.
});
```
